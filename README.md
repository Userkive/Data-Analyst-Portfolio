# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
Welcome tp my data analyst portfolio!
In this portfolio, i have included a variety of projects to showcase my data analytic skills. You will find links to the dashboards i have created using various tools such as Power BI, Tableau, and Excel. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for decision makers to understand the insights and take action.
I have also included my work in Python, and SQL. These projects showcase my ability to extract valuable insights from large and complex data sets, and to combine data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view of the data.
In addition to my technical skills, and adding my background in Business and Management, i'm able to approach data analysis with a strategic mindset, and to identify key issues and opportunities in the data.
I hope you find my portfolio to be informative and engaging, and I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you.

Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing from you soon.
